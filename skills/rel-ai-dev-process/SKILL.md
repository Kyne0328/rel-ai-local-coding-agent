# Rel.AI Development Process

Reuse an active `work_id` when durable attribution is already useful, but do not create one merely to start or interact with a process. Process authority comes from the authenticated principal, authorized workspace, and `processId`; an explicitly supplied work_id must still match any existing task attribution. If `relai_process` returns `reused: true`, continue from that process's readiness/log state rather than starting a duplicate.

Use this process flow: `start with explicit purpose -> determine readiness -> inspect incremental output -> interact only if required -> reuse process -> stop when no longer needed`.

1. Confirm the command is genuinely persistent or interactive. Do not trigger for tests, builds, linters, source checks, release gates, or other one-shot commands; those belong in `relai_exec` or `relai_validate`.
2. Start it with `relai_process` action `start`, an explicit `kind` (`service`, `watcher`, or `interactive`), and a concrete `purpose` explaining why persistence is needed.
3. Determine readiness from startup output or a bounded HTTP probe before treating the process as usable.
4. Read logs incrementally with stdout/stderr offsets. Reuse `metadataRevision` after the first read so unchanged process metadata is not returned repeatedly.
5. Reuse the same live process while it still serves the objective. Write stdin only when an interactive program actually expects it.
6. When the runtime has produced enough evidence, return control to `rel-ai-debugging` for defect work or `rel-ai-verification` for proof instead of keeping process management as the active concern.
7. Stop the process explicitly when it is no longer needed.
8. Use `relai_exec` or `relai_validate` instead for one-shot tests, builds, checks, migrations that terminate, or release gates.
