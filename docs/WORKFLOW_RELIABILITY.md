# Workflow reliability

Rel.AI exposes one canonical public tool surface and supplies repository facts, execution results, optional durable evidence, and hard runtime constraints. It does not maintain a second planner for ChatGPT. The agent chooses the shortest path and appropriate validation for the objective without weakening authorization, containment, resource ownership, collision protection, sensitive-path controls, or defined destructive approvals.

## Runtime authority

Use tools directly against an authorized workspace by default. Start `relai_work` with `action:"begin"` when durable ownership, recovery, task-scoped review/publication, or task history is useful, then supply that `work_id` only on operations that should belong to the durable task. Omitted task identity is never guessed. Rel.AI records factual evidence such as tool outcomes, validation fingerprints, workspace/task mutations, and process state. It does not return advisory `recommendedActions`, `avoidActions`, or synthetic workflow stages.

Authorization, workspace containment, sensitive-file policy, stale-write checks, workspace/task mutation generations, resource ownership, workspace conflicts, Git safety, and defined destructive approvals remain authoritative.

| Concern | Authority |
| --- | --- |
| Authorization, principal identity, workspace containment, sensitive-file policy | Existing runtime safety/authorization modules |
| Workspace/task mutations, mutation generations, validation freshness, and workspace conflicts | `src/taskIntegrity.js` |
| Repository topology, package boundaries, check catalog | `src/workflow/topology.js` and `src/workflow/checkCatalog.js` |
| Safe evidence receipts | Existing durable task history |
| Process ownership and lifecycle | Existing managed-process runtime |
| Next repository action | The agent, based on current evidence and hard runtime constraints |

## Shortest-path examples

These are shapes, not required sequences. Skip any stage that current evidence already satisfies.

### Docs-only

`targeted read -> edit -> review if useful`; add `begin ... finish` only when durable task identity is useful.

Documentation-only work normally does not justify package builds, repository-wide tests, Knip, security scans, or release checks unless repository policy or the changed documentation specifically requires them.

### Local bug fix

`reproduce or inspect -> coherent fix -> directly affected check -> review`; optionally attribute the flow to a durable work session.

Prefer the smallest check that proves the defect is fixed. Broaden only when the affected boundary or risk justifies it.

### Feature slice

`inspect/design only as needed -> implement coherent slice -> package-relevant checks -> review`; use a durable work session when ownership/recovery helps.

Do not validate after every tiny edit. Validate at a meaningful implementation boundary and reuse exact fresh evidence when nothing relevant has changed.

### Investigation

`search/inspect -> targeted reads or measurements -> report`; read-only investigation does not need a synthetic task.

Investigation does not imply mutation or validation. Read and inspection evidence can be sufficient when the objective is explanatory.

### Risky release

`inspect release boundary -> focused regression proof -> required release/build/package checks -> review/publish`; a durable work session is useful when publication should default to task-owned paths.

Release-wide validation is reserved for release, repository, cross-package, migration, dependency, contract, or other genuinely high-risk boundaries. It is not the default conclusion of a local source edit.

## Nested packages and repository topology

Rel.AI discovers package manifests below the configured repository root even when the root itself has no manifest. Nested packages receive stable path-qualified identities such as `npm:front-end` and `npm:back-end`.

Structured validation units carry both a command and package-relative `cwd`. A frontend-only change therefore runs frontend checks from the frontend package directory instead of silently invoking backend checks from the repository root. Identical command names in different package directories remain distinct validation units.

Topology discovery is bounded by depth, manifest count, and excluded generated/sensitive directories. Manifest metadata is cached by a repository-topology fingerprint rather than rescanned without limit on every tool call.

## Boundary and risk

Validation breadth is derived from the changed boundary and risk, not from file count alone. Many files inside one package can still be package-local. Shared contracts, dependency manifests, security/configuration surfaces, release workflows, migrations, and cross-package changes can widen the boundary or raise risk.

Boundary/risk helpers provide factual context for validation selection and reporting. The agent chooses what to run; existing integrity and safety owners enforce only their concrete runtime boundaries.

## Evidence reuse and freshness

Rel.AI stores safe evidence receipts in the existing durable task-history record. Receipts contain identifiers, outcomes, generations, safe paths, timing/status metadata, and repository fingerprints; they do not persist raw stdout/stderr, environment values, headers, credentials, or full tool arguments.

A passed validation result is reusable only when all of these still match exactly:

- structured check identity or command identity;
- normalized command;
- package-relative `cwd`;
- current repository fingerprint.

A changed repository fingerprint makes prior validation evidence stale. Mutation generation also separates retry epochs: repeated failures are counted only within the same task mutation generation. A new mutation resets the repeated-failure strategy.

When an exact passed receipt is fresh, Rel.AI reuses the proof without re-executing the command or replaying its old output. Connector results report executed and reused units separately.

Read evidence may also record bounded file hashes and line ranges. Search/context gathering can avoid rereading the same proven range only while the file hash still matches; it never uses that optimization as an access boundary or hard search filter.

## Edits and validation cadence

Edit shape and validation cadence are separate decisions. Use `relai_edit` for repository mutations and choose exact replacement, content replacement, patch text, or a bounded multi-file batch according to the change shape.

`runChecks` remains explicit. Rel.AI does not universally force validation after edits. The agent selects risk-matched checks when they are useful, and Rel.AI records the resulting evidence as passed, failed, stale, or not run.

For changed source, prefer directly affected tests first, then the cheapest package-relevant lint/type/test/build evidence needed for the boundary. Migration commands are never auto-selected as validation checks.

## Review scope

Task-scoped review defaults to files authoritatively owned by the current `work_id`. Ambient dirty files remain visible as excluded workspace changes but are not mixed into the task diff. Use `scope:"workspace"` only when the objective intentionally requires workspace-wide review.

Sensitive-file review keeps the existing redaction rules. Workflow guidance does not weaken them.

## Persistent processes

Use `relai_process` only for persistent services, watchers, previews, or interactive programs. One-shot tests, builds, linters, and scripts belong in `relai_exec` or `relai_validate`.

Rel.AI may reuse an active managed process only when its existing reuse fingerprint is compatible. Process access itself is authorized by principal + workspace + `processId`; `work_id` is optional attribution, and an explicitly supplied mismatched work_id is rejected rather than ignored. A reused result returns `reused:true` and current readiness state.

## Repeated failures

Rel.AI fingerprints safe failure facts such as tool/action identity, normalized command, `cwd`, error code, and safe target so repeated evidence can be recognized without persisting sensitive output. The agent decides whether repetition calls for diagnosis, repair, or another action. A new mutation starts a new evidence epoch.

## Inactivity and resumption

`inactive` is a non-terminal, resumable work-session state. A quiescent session keeps the same `work_id`, title, objective, counters, task-integrity state, task-owned changes, validation generations, and durable safe evidence. It receives `inactiveAt` but no terminal `endedAt`, `completedAt`, or `cancelledAt` timestamp.

A valid same-`work_id` call from the authorized principal in the bound workspace implicitly resumes the logical task into an active state. This is distinct from:

- explicit cancellation, which is terminal;
- explicit completion, which is terminal;
- a true terminal failure, which is terminal.

Historical records that used `inactivity_window` as cancellation/failure are normalized to resumable `inactive` when there is no explicit terminal action. Terminal sessions never reopen through inactivity handling.

## Completion and validation evidence

Validation evidence does not decide whether the agent may consider its objective complete. `src/taskIntegrity.js` remains the factual authority for task/workspace mutations, ownership/conflicts, and whether recorded validation is current for the repository state.

Use current structured validation when it helps prove the objective. Do not rerun an unchanged exact check merely to create ceremonial "final" verification. If a durable work session exists, `relai_validate` with `complete:true` remains an optional convenience to validate and close that exact session atomically; `relai_work` with `action:"finish"` may also close it while truthfully reporting validation as passed, failed, stale, not run, or not required.

A completed plan checklist or model statement cannot falsify Rel.AI's recorded evidence. Conversely, missing/stale/failed validation is evidence for the agent to evaluate, not a generic harness veto on completion.

## Observability and privacy

Rel.AI records bounded factual activity/evidence rather than a duplicate workflow planner. Durable task history is only created for explicit work sessions; taskless operations remain workspace/resource activity and must not manufacture "Planning" or "Inactive" tasks. Persistent evidence and dashboard projections exclude raw command output, environment values, headers, credentials, and other secret-bearing fields.

Ordinary evidence collection consumes existing authority facts and cached topology. It must not spawn a fresh global `git status` process after every read or other ordinary tool call.

## Recovery and publishing

Use `relai_changes` restore/reset/tidy actions only for the requested recovery scope. Publishing remains explicit through `relai_publish`; no evidence or planning helper commits or pushes automatically, and push targets are validated from the repository's actual Git remotes at execution time.

When executing an approved multi-task plan, use a durable work session only when its persistent ownership/recovery benefits matter. Verify each completion condition and update checklists only when evidence proves it. Consolidate accumulated implementation as the plan advances instead of layering duplicate owners or compatibility paths.
